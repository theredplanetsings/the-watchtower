# The Watchtower

The Watchtower is a project dedicated to enhancing communication and rapid response within the field of law enforcement. This project serves as a tip line dashboard that connects users with various law enforcement agencies, offering an intuitive interface for reporting tips and staying informed.

## Overview

- **Purpose:**  
  The Watchtower provides a centralized platform for reporting and tracking tips related to law enforcement activities. It connects users with agencies such as the FBI, CIA, NSA, and others, streamlining the process of submitting critical information.

- **Technology:**  
  This project leverages modern web technologies, including D3.js for data visualization and localStorage for persisting user settings. The design is built with a strong focus on user experience and accessibility.

## New Features & Enhancements

- **Multi-Language Support:**  
  Users can now select a language from several options (English, Spanish, French, Russian, German, and Chinese). The chosen language persists between page loads and navigations using localStorage. This ensures a consistent user experience even after refreshing or moving between pages.

- **Improved Tip Line Dashboard:**  
  The tip line dashboard now includes a dedicated return button positioned to the left of the dashboard header. This button allows users to quickly navigate back to the main page without disrupting the overall layout.

- **Responsive and Intuitive UI:**  
  Enhancements have been made to button designs and layout organization in both the homepage and tip line dashboard, ensuring a cohesive look across the platform.

## Interest in Law Enforcement

My personal interest in law enforcement drives this project. I am passionate about creating tools that enhance public safety and facilitate efficient communication between the community and law enforcement agencies. By bridging technology and public service, I aim to contribute to more effective and timely responses to incidents and tips.

## Future Work

- **Tool Expansion:**  
  More interactive tools and features will be added to improve the functionality of the dashboard. This includes advanced data analysis, enhanced reporting features, and integration with additional law enforcement and public safety tools.

- **User Feedback:**  
  I plan to gather user feedback and iterate on the design and functionality of the platform to ensure it meets the needs of both the community and law enforcement professionals.
